| GitLab                   | This machine contains a source code management system (SCM), CI/CD system, and many other tools                  |
| GitLab runner            | This machine acts as a slave machine in master/slave systems architecture and executes commands given by GitLab master |
| Production               | This machine acts as the production machine                                                                      |
| Vulnerability Management | This machine hosts vulnerability management software to manage the vulnerabilities found as part of the day-to-day security scans |
| Other machines           | Other machines in the lab are introduced in the appropriate exercises like Docker Registry, SonarQube, Jenkins, etc., |
